# Reality Mining
Machine learning approach to Reality Mining: The Reality Mining dataset.

## Overview
This is my proposal for the application of unsupervised classiÔ¨Åcation methods to the [Reality Mining dataset](http://realitycommons.media.mit.edu/realitymining.html) . 
This project consists of two main parts: the code and a report on the project in which I explain my approach in detail.

## Dependencies
